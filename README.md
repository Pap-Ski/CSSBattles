# CSSBattle SUBMISSIONS

### My submissions to a few css battles from [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/)

CSSBattle is an online CSS [Code Golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) game. Here, players from all around the world try to visually replicate "Targets" in smallest possible CSS code and battle it out to get to the top of the leaderboard.
